        <p>This week I visited the official website of the British Museum. The page is simple and easy to operate.
   
            <h1>A little background information
        <p>The British Museum was built in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. Its ownership of some of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed. We don't talk about this, but focus on its website. 
            
            <h1>How to exist 
        <p>Most of the British Museum's exhibitions are free to the public. As a charity the Museum relies on donations. They also sell cultural and creative products, such as copies of collections, stationery, dolls and other derivatives. Under the situation of pandemic, they made masks with Collectible designs. Cultural and creative products are very common, which is the main way for museums to exist.

            <h1>About the third party platform
        <p>They show HD photos of the collection, with text below. They use third-party platforms, such as Google Street View and Sketchfab. Through Google Street View, the picture can be changed from 2D to 3D, and our perspective can enter the museum interior to realize the visit. But there are some drawbacks. For example, we can't read the text introduction clearly. On the contrary, the 3D model shows us all aspects of the collection, as well as the interior of the collection. That's cool. I hope I can have a chance to learn 3D and make a 3D model by myself. 

        <p>In addition, they also have Audio tour, blog, podcast, etc. People can learn more about the collection in their favorite way.

        <p>Visiting collections online can make up for the regret that people can't go to museums, but going to museums in person will be more impressive.
